      <p class="landing">You might be familiar with the tech term "fork" &mdash; it's used to describe the action of using someone else's code as the starting point for your own project. In restaurants and bars, we often talk about a cocktail being a "riff"  or "spin" on an existing (and often well-known) drink.Users can fork any cocktail on the site. Whether it's your own cocktail or someone else's, use that recipe as a starting point for your new creation. The database automatically keeps track of a forked cocktail's geneology, both its parent and its children.</p>
